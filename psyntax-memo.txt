Psyntax memo for Mosh.

  Add line like(get-environment-variables sys) to psyntax-buildscript-mosh.ss.

* Test r6rs

  make r6rs-test

(1) regexp
Mosh has regexp literal like #/^ /.
Psyntax doesn't know about regexp, so it causes error.

(stx-error e "invalid expression") occurs on chi-expr at expander.ss.

I think regexp literal is classified into (constant).
So self-evaluating? returns #t for regexp literal, it works well.
