#summary Mosh source code is now at GitHub

= Source Repository =

https://github.com/higepon/mosh

= Build from Git Source =

(Release tarball and mosh-current.tar.gz are already "bootstrapped". If you build from them, you can just `./configure && make && make install`.)

You will need some additional tool if you decided build Mosh from Git source. Install subversion, re2c, bison, autoconf, automake, Gauche and latest mosh-current tarball release ( http://storage.osdev.info/pub/mosh/mosh-current.tar.gz ) then `./gen-git-build.sh`.

gen-git-build currently not "fail-proof". Please run `git clean` if you failed something in generation process.
