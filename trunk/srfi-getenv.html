<H1>Title</H1>

An interface to access environment variables.

<H1>Abstract</H1>

This SRFI specifies the procedure getenv which gets the value of the specified environment variable.

<H1>Issues</H1>

<H1>Rationale</H1>
Most operating systems provide the mechanism of passing auxiliary parameters implicitly to child processes, namely called enviornment variables.
Some applications rely on environment variables to modify their behavior according to the local settings.
Most implementations of common gateway interface (CGI) uses environment variables to pass Meta-Variables from the server to the script[1].
Providing the means to access to the environment variables is indispensable to write practical programs in Scheme.
In fact, most widely-used Scheme implementations provide the means of getting the value of the specified environment variable, usually called getenv.
Additionally, some implementations provide the means to get all environment variables.
Conceptually, environment variables are mappings from string names to values.
For example, CGI programs may obtain the values of the Meta-Variabes such as "QUERY_STRING", "CONTENT_LENGTH" and "REQUEST_METHOD", as the following examples:
<pre>
(getenv "QUERY_STRING") => "foo=bar&huga=hige"
(getenv "CONTENT_LENGTH") => "512"
(getenv "REQUEST_METHOD") => "post"
</pre>

Therefore, it is quite useful to define the environment-independent way to get environment variables.
