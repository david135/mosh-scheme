;  THIS FILE CONTAINS A LISP ASSOCIATION LIST WITH A LAML CONFIGURATION.
;  AN ASSOCIATION LIST IS A LIST OF KEY-VALUE PAIRS: (key . value).
;  EDIT THIS FILE BY CHANGING THE VALUES OF THE KEYS (AT THE
;  POSITIONS AFTER THE DOTS). THERE ARE ALREADY EXAMPLES OF
;  VALUES (SUCH AS "c:/programs/laml/") IN THIS FILE.
;  AFTER YOU HAVE EDITED THIS FILE PLEASE LOAD THE FILE 
;  laml-config.scm IN YOUR SCHEME SYSTEM. THIS IS THE SCHEME PROGRAM
;  WHICH PERFORMS THE CONFIGURATIN PROCESS. THE LOADING PROCESS WILL
;  READ THE CURRENT FILE, configuration, AND IT WILL CONFIGURE LAML 
;  ON YOUR COMPUTER.
;
;  NOTICE THAT THE EXISTING VALUES IN THIS FILE REFLECT A WINDOWS 2000 
;  OR WINDOWS XP SETUP WITH PLT MZSCHEME (version 200 .. 209).


(
  ; A full and absolute path to the directory in which your 
  ; LAML or SchmeDoc distribution is located.
  ; Always use forward slashes in the path.
  ; The last character should be a '/'.

  ; Which Scheme system do you use:   mzscheme, mzscheme-200, mzscheme-300, scm, guile, sisc, drscheme, or drscheme-300.
  ; mzscheme refers to versions smaller than 200 of MzScheme (103, 101, ...).
  ; mzscheme-200 refers to version 200 - 209. As of April 2005, version 209 is the latest version.
  ; mzscheme-300 refers to version 300+. 
  ; drscheme refers to versions smaller than 200 of DrScheme.
  ; drscheme-300 refers to version 300 or larger of DrScheme.
  ; The value part of the cons pair should be a symbol or a string.

  ; On which platform do you install LAML: windows, unix, or mac.
  ; If you use linux use unix here.
  ; If you use max OSX, use unix here too.
  ; The given value should be a symbol or a string

  ; Which operating system do you use: win98, win95, nt40, win2000,
  ; solaris-6, solaris-7, or linux.
  ; If you use Windows XP or Vista you should write win2000 below.
  ; If you use solaris in a newer version than 7, you should write solaris-7.
  ; The value of operating-system should be a symbol or a string.

  (operating-system . "linux")                ; <== Edit here


  ; The absolute path to your Scheme interpreter.
  ; The value must be a string (an absolute file path) or the value #f 
  ; (#f means boolean false).
  ; Use forward slashes in the path.
  ; Do not include any file extension (such as '.exe').
  ; If your Scheme system is drscheme or drscheme-300 use the value #f.

  ; If you give the path to you emacs init file here, you allow the
  ; LAML configuration program to change your .emacs file.
  ; If you do not have an emacs init file, the LAML configuration program
  ; will make one for you. In case you do NOT want the LAML configuration 
  ; process to modify your emacs init file, the value of this property should
  ; be #f (which is Scheme's representation of 'false').

  ; The value of laml-init-file must be a string (file path), or the boolean #f.
  ; The laml init file allows you to customize and extend LAML.
  ; The laml init file is loaded by the function begin-laml, which always should be
  ; called when program loading has been completed.
  ; The laml init file is only loaded if it actually exists.
  ; If you delete this clause, or if you specify the value #f,
  ; no laml init file is supported by your installation.

  ; Possible values are "original", "hygienic", and "none".
  ; Some original keybindings may be in conflict with other Emacs key bindings,
  ; but they are short and convenient.
  ; Hygienic keybindings all start with C-c, and as such they do not conflict
  ; with other keybindings. If "none" is specified, no keybindings are will be made.
  ; Menu bindings will be made even if "none" is specified as the value of 
  ; emacs-keybindings.

  ; select Emacs support for LENO, a number of key bindings and
  ; menu bindings will be in effect.
  ; Use the value #f if you install SchemeDoc

  ; Emacs support of the Scheme Elucidator, the value of
  ; elucidator-emacs-support should be #t.  If not, it should be #f.
  ; If you select Emacs support for the elucidator,
  ; a number of key bindings and menu bindings will be in effect.
  ; You may use the value #t if you install SchemeDoc, because

  ; The LAML photo show tool supports the generation of HTML
  ; files that controls the presentation of digital photos. 
  ; The value #t will give some support of the LAML photo show from Emacs.
  ; Use the value #f if you install SchemeDoc
